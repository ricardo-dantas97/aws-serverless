- Core concepts - Tables, Items, Attributes, Indexes

A table is a collection of items and each items is a collection of Attributes.
An item is a set of attributes that can be uniquely identified among all of the other items
Each item is composed of one or more attributes

- Primary Key, Partition Key and Sort Key
PK is the key that uniquely indentifies an item in the table. DynamoDB supports two different kinds of PK
    Partition Key - Simple PK, composed of one attribute know as the partition key
    Partition Key and Sort Key - Composite primary key, two attributes.

- Partitions and data distribution with partition key and sort key
Partition is an allocation of storage for a table, backed by SSD drivers and automatically replicated across multiple AZs. Partition management performs automatically.

Data distribution: Partition Key
If table has a partition key, DynamoDB stores and gets each item based on its partition key value

Data distribution: Partition Key and Sort Key
If table has a composite primary key, DynamoDB calculates the hash value of the partition key, stores all the items with the same partition key values close together, and ordered by sort key value.
